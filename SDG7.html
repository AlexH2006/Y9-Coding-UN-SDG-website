	<h2>What Is Renewable Energy:</h2>
	<p class="opt1">Renewable energy is also known as clean energy and sustainable energy. Renewable energy is energy that has been derived from earth’s natural resources that are not finite or exhaustible, such as wind and sunlight. Renewable energy is an alternative to the traditional energy that relies on fossil fuels, and it tends to be much  less harmful to the environment.</p>

	<h2>Renewable Energy Is Diverse:</h2>
	<p class="opt1">There are a variety of renewable energy. Here, several diffrent common forms of renewable energy are included:</p>

	<h3>Solar Energy:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Solar energy is derived by capturing radiant energy from sunlight and converting it into heat, electricity, or hot water. In fact, more energy from the sun falls on the earth in one hour than is used by everyone in the world in one year. A variety of technologies convert sunlight to usable energy for buildings. The most commonly used solar technologies for homes and businesses are solar photovoltaics for electricity, passive solar design for space heating and cooling, and solar water heating.</p>
	<p class="opt1">The government and some of the commercial companies will construct giant solar farms to generate industry-used electricitty. The largest solar farm is the Bhadla Solar Park in India. The power of the farm is 2245 MW, which is equivalent to 2.245 Billion Watt.</p>

	<h3>Wind Energy:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Wind farms capture the energy of wind flow by using turbines and converting it into electricity. There are several forms of systems used to convert wind energy and each vary. Commercial grade wind-powered generating systems can power many different organizations, while single-wind turbines are used to help supplement pre-existing energy organizations. Another form is utility-scale wind farms, which are purchased by contract or wholesale. Technically, wind energy is a form of solar energy. The phenomenon we call “wind” is caused by the differences in temperature in the atmosphere combined with the rotation of Earth and the geography of the planet.</p>
	<p class="opt1">The wind farms usually locate in places with strong winds, such as desert or on prairie. In countries such as UK, Denmark, and Netherland, there are also quite a few off-shore wind farms. The power of the wind farms are incredibly high. The largest wind farm, Gansu Wind Farm, locates in North Western China has a power of 8 Bliion Wat, which can support around 17.5 New York City.</p>

	</aside>
	<h3>Hydroelectric Power:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Hydroelectric power is one of the ealiest power that people use to generate electricity. Hydropower became an electricity source in the late 19th century, a few decades after British-American engineer James Francis developed the first modern water turbine. In 1882, the world’s first hydroelectric power plant began operating in the United States along the Fox River in Appleton, Wisconsin. Dams are what people most associate when it comes to hydroelectric power. Water flows through the dam’s turbines to produce electricity, known as pumped-storage hydropower. Run-of-river hydropower uses a channel to funnel water through rather than powering it through a dam.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Nowadays, hydroelectric power has become one of the most important power resources. According to the International Energy Agency, hydropower contributed about 17% of the total electricity production in the world. Especially in tropical countries, such as Brazil and Egypt, hydroelectricity has become an indispensable part of the energy structure. The largest hydroelectric plant in the world, Three Gorges Dam, can out put 22.5 Billion Watt of elctricity, which can support the electricy of more than 50 New York City.</p>

	</aside>
	<h3>Geothermal Energy:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Geothermal heat is heat that is trapped beneath the earth’s crust from the formation of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago and from radioactive decay. Sometimes large amounts of this heat escapes naturally, but all at once, resulting in familiar occurrences, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers. This heat can be captured and used to produce geothermal energy by using steam that comes from the heated water pumping below the surface, which then rises to the top and can be used to operate a turbine.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Dur to the high cost and immature technology, the thermal energy plants are not widely used in the world. Hopefully, in the future, the geothermal  energy will also be a signifcant part in the renewable energy.</p>

	<h2>Renewable Energy Is Benefitial:</h2>
	<h3>Less global warming:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Most renewable energy sources produce little to no global warming emissions. Even when including “life cycle” emissions of clean energy (ie, the emissions from each stage of a technology’s life—manufacturing, installation, operation, decommissioning), the global warming emissions associated with renewable energy are minimal.</p>
	<p class="opt1">The comparison becomes clear when you look at the numbers. Burning natural gas for electricity releases between 0.6 and 2 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (CO2E/kWh); coal emits between 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of CO2E/kWh. Wind, on the other hand, is responsible for only 0.02 to 0.04 pounds of CO2E/kWh on a life-cycle basis; solar 0.07 to 0.2; geothermal 0.1 to 0.2; and hydroelectric between 0.1 and 0.5.</p>
	<h3>Improved public health:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">A lot of the negative health impacts come from air and water pollution that clean energy technologies simply don’t produce. Wind, solar, and hydroelectric systems generate electricity with no associated air pollution emissions. Geothermal and biomass systems emit some air pollutants, though total air emissions are generally much lower than those of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.</p>
	<p class="opt1">In addition, wind and solar energy require essentially no water to operate and thus do not pollute water resources or strain supplies by competing with agriculture, drinking water, or other important water needs. In contrast, fossil fuels can have a significant impact on water resources: both coal mining and natural gas drilling can pollute sources of drinking water, and all thermal power plants, including those powered by coal, gas, and oil, withdraw and consume water for cooling.</p>
	<h3>Inexhaustible energy:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Strong winds, sunny skies, abundant plant matter, heat from the earth, and fast-moving water can each provide a vast and constantly replenished supply of energy. A relatively small fraction of Canada electricity currently comes from these sources, but that could change: studies have repeatedly shown that renewable energy can provide a significant share of future electricity needs, even after accounting for potential constraints.</p>
