	<h2>What Is Climate Change:</h2>
	<p class="opt1">To learn about climate change, you first must know what climate is. NASA decribes climate and its difference to weather as the following: </p>
	<p class="opt1">You might know what weather is. Weather is the changes we see and feel outside from day to day. It might rain one day and be sunny the next. Sometimes it is cold. Sometimes it is hot. Weather also changes from place to place. People in one place might be wearing shorts and playing outside. At the same time, people far away might be shoveling snow.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Climate is the usual weather of a place. Climate can be different for different seasons. A place might be mostly warm and dry in the summer. The same place may be cool and wet in the winter. Different places can have different climates. You might live where it snows all the time. And some people live where it is always warm enough to swim outside!</p>
	<p class="opt1">There's also Earth's climate. Earth's climate is what you get when you combine all the climates around the world together.</p>

	<h2>Climate Change Have Severe Consequences:</h2>

	<h3>Melting Poles and Rising Sea Level:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Due to the rising of global temperature, the polar ice caps in Artica and Antarctica started to melt. According to WWF organization, we lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, and over the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by a stunning 95%. The melting ice caps have and will continue to cause serious issues.</p>
	<p class="opt1"><b>Wild Life: </b>When there’s less sea ice, animals that depend on it for survival must adapt or perish. Loss of ice and melting permafrost spells trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer, and many other species. As they are affected, so too are the other species that depend on them, in addition to people. Wildlife and people are coming into more frequent contact – and often conflict – as wildlife encroach on Arctic communities, looking for refuge as their sea ice habitat disappears.</p>
	<p class="opt1"><b>Coastal Comunitties: </b>Global average sea level has risen by about 7–8 inches since 1900 and it’s getting worse. Rising seas endanger coastal cities and small island nations by exacerbating coastal flooding and storm surge, making dangerous weather events even more so. Glacial melt of the Greenland ice sheet is a major predictor of future sea level rise; if it melts entirely, global sea levels could rise 20 feet.</p>

	<h3>More Droughts And Heat Waves:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Across the globe, hot days are getting hotter and more frequent, while we’re experiencing fewer cold days. Over the past decade, daily record high temperatures have occurred twice as often as record lows across the North America, up from a near 1:1 ratio in the 1950s. Heat waves are becoming more common, and intense heat waves are more frequent in the West Coastal Area. Many probably still remember the summer of 2021 in Vancouver and Los Angles.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Extreme heat can increase the risk of other types of disasters. Heat can exacerbate drought, and hot, dry conditions can in turn create wildfire conditions. Buildings, roads, and infrastructure absorb heat, leading to temperatures that can be 1 to 3 degrees Celsius hotter in urban areas than outlying areas – a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This impact is most intense during the day, but the slow release of heat from the infrastructure (or an atmospheric heat island) overnight can keep cities much hotter than surrounding areas. Rising temperatures across the country pose a threat to people, ecosystems, and the economy.</p>

	<h3>Change in Precipitation:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Total annual precipitation has increased over land areas worldwide. Since 1901, precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.1 inches per decade over land areas worldwide. However, shifting weather patterns have caused certain areas, such as the Central Inland North America, to experience less precipitation than usual.</p>
	<p class="opt1">In recent years, a higher percentage of precipitation in North America has come in the form of intense single-day events. The prevalence of extreme single-day precipitation events remained fairly steady between 1910 and the 1980s but has risen substantially since then. Continentalwide, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1996. The occurrence of abnormally high annual precipitation totals (as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) has also increased.</p>
	<p class="opt1">In 2021, the British Columbia, particularly Vancouver, had experienced one of the most severe floods, caused by heavy precipitation, in history. The image showes the Vancouver streets were filled with water.</p>

	<h2>Climate Change Causes:</h2>
	<p class="opt1">Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, people have burned more and more fossil fuels and changed vast areas of land from forests to farmland.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”. The greenhouse effect makes the earth warmer, just as a greenhouse is warmer than its surroundings.</p>
