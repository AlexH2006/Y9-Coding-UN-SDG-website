	<h2>Causes and Consequences Of Climate Change:</h2>
	<p class="opt1">As the United Nations stated: "Energy is at the heart of the climate challenge – and key to the solution."</p>
	<p class="opt1">Although many countries are trying to alter the energy structure, fossil fuels, such as coals, gases, oil, are still the dominating human energy comsuption.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels – coal, oil, or gas – causes a large chunk of the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Because of the greenhouse effect and greenhouse gas emission, the temperature are rising rapidly, the ice caps in polar areas are melting and the sea-level is rising, which resulted in a series of serious environmental and humanitarian disasters.</p>

	<h2>Solution to Climate Change- Renewable Energy:</h2>
	<p class="opt1">Most electricity is still generated by burning fossil fuels, but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. About 29 percent of electricity currently comes from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, which nature will replenish and which emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air. The cost of renewable-energy technologies also keeps falling, making renewables the most affordable source of power today.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Compared to fossil fuels, renewable energy is much more cleaner. Although renewable energy technologies can cause some emissions, overall, minimum carbon and greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, will be emitted to the environment when using them.</p>
	<p class="opt1">Therefore, in the future, if the renewable energy is widely used in our everyday life. Much less carbon and greenhouse gases will be released, which will ultimately stop the climate change and the global warming.</p>

	<h2>What Can We Do:</h2>
	<h3>1. Renewable Energy At Home:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Choose a utility company that generates at least half its power from wind or solar and has been certified by Green-e Energy, an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, take a look at your electric bill; many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on their monthly statements and websites.</p>
	<h3>2. Weatherize</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Indeed, heating and air-conditioning account for almost half of home energy use. You can make your space more energy efficient by sealing drafts and ensuring it’s adequately insulated. You can also claim federal tax credits for many energy-efficiency home improvements.</p>
	<h3>3. Reduce water waste:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Saving water reduces carbon pollution, too. That's because it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and treat your water. So take shorter showers, turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, and switch to WaterSense-labeled fixtures and appliances. The EPA estimates that if just one out of every 100 American homes were retrofitted with water-efficient fixtures, about 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year would be saved—avoiding 80,000 tons of global warming pollution.</p>
	<h3>4. Pull the plug(s):</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Taken together, the outlets in your home are likely powering about 65 different devices—an average load for a home in the U.S. Audio and video devices, cordless vacuums and power tools, and other electronics use energy even when they're not charging. This "idle load" across all U.S. households adds up to the output of 50 large power plants in the U.S. So don't leave fully charged devices plugged into your home's outlets, unplug rarely used devices or plug them into power strips and timers, and adjust your computers and monitors to automatically power down to the lowest power mode when not in use.</p>
	<h3>5. Buy better bulbs:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">LED lightbulbs use up to 80 percent less energy than conventional incandescents. They’re also cheaper in the long run: A 10-watt LED that replaces your traditional 60-watt bulb will save you $125 over the lightbulb’s life.</p>
	<h3>6. Rethink planes, trains, and automobiles:</h3>
	<p class="opt1">Choosing to live in walkable smart-growth cities and towns with quality public transportation leads to less driving, less money spent on fuel, and less pollution in the air. Less frequent flying can make a big difference, too. Air transport is a major source of climate pollution. If you can take a train instead, do that.</p>
